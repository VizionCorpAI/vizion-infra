# USER.md

## Preferences
- Keep documentation current — reflect reality, not aspirations
- Default to central scheduling (vizion-scheduling) for recurring work
- Use alert-reporting as the event bus for cross-workspace communication
- DocOps should be triggered after major changes, not constantly
- GitHub Wiki must stay in sync with local wiki/

## Safety
- Never commit credentials or API tokens
- Treat any secret pasted into chat as compromised; rotate it
- Never delete wiki pages without user confirmation
- Audit artifacts are append-only
