# Learning University

This “learning” space pulls together the knowledge runway for every workspace:

- **Frequent problems** (`wiki/frequent_problems/`) capture real-world failure cases.  
- **How To** (`wiki/how_to/`) records verified remediation sequences.  
- **State logs** (`state/docops_runs.log`, `state/audit_registry_*.log`, `state/validate_structure_*.log`) show what DocOps observed and fixed.  
- **Audit snapshots** (`wiki/audit/`) document architectures, ports, services, OpenClaw, and n8n states.

Everyone in the environment (maintenance, security, analytics, platform, onboarding, etc.) can query this university before searching externally. When new lessons arise, log them here so the system “learns” and shares the fix alongside the Infisical catalog tracked under `vizion-security/docs/secrets_catalog.md`.
