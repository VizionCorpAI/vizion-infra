# How To

The How To folder stores concise remediation steps that the learning module writes whenever a maintenance audit or DocOps run resolves an issue.

Each entry pairs with a Frequent problem and includes:

- **Trigger**: the error message/log snippet or drift detection that kicked off the fix.
- **Action**: the exact commands/scripts/config changes applied.
- **Verification**: tests/health checks confirming the fix.

Workflows (maintenance, security, analytics, and audit) can reference these pages to resolve repeated failures with minimal operator input.
