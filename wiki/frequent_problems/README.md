# Frequent problems

This folder captures recurring issues uncovered during DocOps runs, audit snapshots, and workspace maintenance. Each entry should include:

- **Problem**: what failed or drifted (logs, symptoms, Git status, etc.).
- **Fixes applied**: commands/scripts run or configuration adjustments made.
- **Outcome**: verification steps and whether the issue recurred.

The learning module referenced in `architecture/08_maintenance_audit.md` watches for these logs and automatically suggests new How To entries when similar fixes recur.
